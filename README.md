# DA Builder Sample Integration

This repository contains a comprehensive sample integration for [Spire's DA Builder](https://docs.spire.dev/da-builder), demonstrating how to integrate with the DA Builder service to save money on Ethereum transactions through aggregation.

## üí∞ Cost Savings

DA Builder is [built to save you money](https://docs.spire.dev/da-builder/the-rollup-cost-killer).

## üéØ Sample Integration Repository Objectives

This sample integration will help you complete the following objectives:

1. **Get testnet ETH** for your EOA (Externally Owned Account)
2. **Deploy the TrustlessProposer contract** (example that can be expanded upon to meet your needs for production)
3. **Set your EOA account code** using EIP-7702 with the TrustlessProposer
4. **Deposit funds** into the GasTank contract
5. **Submit a transaction** to DA Builder on testnet
6. **Verify the transaction** onchain showing calls being made to the inbox contract

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The integration follows the flow described in the [DA Builder documentation](https://docs.spire.dev/da-builder/architecture):

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.70+**
- **Foundry**
- **An Ethereum wallet**
- **Testnet ETH** (see step 4 below)

### Setup

1. **Clone and setup:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd da-builder-sample-integration
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/setup.sh
```

2. **Generate a test wallet (recommended):**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning:** Never use your main wallet's private key for testing. Create a separate test wallet.

You can generate a new test wallet using Foundry's `cast` command:

```bash
# Generate a new private key and address
cast wallet new
```

3. **Set environment variables:**
```bash
# Required for all deployments
export PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key_here"

# Testnet defaults (Hoodi - can be overridden)
export TARGET_CHAIN="hoodi"                                     # Default: "hoodi"
export RPC_URL="https://ethereum-hoodi-rpc.publicnode.com"      # Auto-configured per chain
export DA_BUILDER_API_URL="https://da-builder.hoodi.spire.dev/" # Auto-configured per chain

# Optional: Override for other chains
export TARGET_CHAIN="holesky"                                   # Holesky Prod
export TARGET_CHAIN="mainnet"                                   # Ethereum Mainnet

# For mainnet deployment
export TARGET_CHAIN="mainnet"
export RPC_URL="your_mainnet_rpc_endpoint"                      # REQUIRED for mainnet
export GAS_TANK_ADDRESS="0x..."                                 # Optional override
export PROPOSER_MULTICALL_ADDRESS="0x..."                       # Optional override
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** For mainnet deployment, you **must** override the RPC_URL with your own Ethereum RPC endpoint. The default URL is for Hoodi testnet only.

### Chain Configuration Details

| Chain        | Chain ID | DA Builder URL                        | GasTank Address                            | ProposerMulticall Address                  |

4. **Get testnet ETH:**
   - **Hoodi**: https://hoodi-faucet.pk910.de/
   - **Holesky**: https://holesky-faucet.pk910.de/

### 5. Deploy Contracts and Run Integration

Deploy the necessary contracts and run the complete integration using the Rust CLI tool:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

**üöÄ Automatic Build Process:** The build system will automatically:
1. **Compile Solidity contracts** with `forge build` (if artifacts don't exist)
2. **Generate Rust bindings** from the compiled contracts
3. **Compile the Rust application**

This single command will then:
- Deploy the TrustlessProposer contract
- Set up EIP-7702 account code
- Deposit funds into the GasTank
- Submit a transaction to DA Builder
- Monitor on-chain execution
- Demonstrate account closing

### 6. Verify on Etherscan

1. Go to [Hoodi Etherscan](https://hoodi.etherscan.io/) or [Hoodi Blockscout](https://eth-hoodi.blockscout.com/)
2. Search for your wallet address
3. Check the transaction history
4. Verify the calls to the GasTank and other contracts

## üìã Proposer Implementations

Example proposer implementations are available in the `src/proposers/` folder:

- **TrustlessProposer**: Requires a signature proving the underlying call is from the EOA owner
- **UnsafeProposer**: For testing/demonstration only, simplifies the process to make what is happening easier to follow
- **OPStackProposer**: Unsafe but emits events that could be useful for OP Stack chains

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite to verify everything works:

```bash
# Run Solidity tests
forge test

# Run Rust tests
cargo test
```

## üî® Build Process

The project uses a custom build script (`build.rs`) that automatically handles the Solidity-to-Rust binding generation:

### Automatic Build Flow
1. **`cargo build`** triggers the build script
2. **Build script runs** `forge build` automatically
3. **Forge handles dependency checking** and only rebuilds what's necessary
4. **Generates Rust bindings** from the compiled contract artifacts
5. **Creates `src/generated_contracts.rs`** with Alloy `sol!` macro bindings

This build script may have some limitations regarding its ability to generate bindings. It currently only generates bindings for the contracts in the `src/interfaces`, `src/mocks`, and `src/proposers` directories but could easily be modified to include others. `forge bind` might be a better option for more complex projects.

### Build Artifacts
- **`out/`**: Forge compilation artifacts (JSON files with ABI and bytecode)
- **`src/generated_contracts.rs`**: Auto-generated Rust bindings using Alloy's `sol!` macro

## üîÑ Integration Steps

The complete integration performs these steps:

1. **Deploy TrustlessProposer** - Deploy the secure proposer contract
2. **Set up EIP-7702 account code** - Use CREATE2 to deploy proposer to EOA address
3. **Deposit into Gas Tank** - Deposit ETH into the DA Builder Gas Tank
4. **Submit transaction to DA Builder** - Create and submit a transaction
5. **Monitor execution** - Track the transaction on-chain
6. **Account closing** - Demonstrate account closure and fund withdrawal

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Insufficient funds" error**
- Make sure you have Hoodi testnet ETH
- Check your balance: `cast balance <address> --rpc-url $RPC_URL`

**"Contract not found" error**
- Verify the contract addresses are correct
- Make sure you're using the right network (Hoodi)

**"Signature invalid" error**
- Check that your private key matches your wallet address
- Verify the EIP-712 signature is correct

**"Unauthorized" error**
- Make sure you're calling from the correct address
- TrustlessProposer only accepts calls that have been signed by the EOA owner and originate from itself or the designated multicall contract
